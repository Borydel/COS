Common ontology of system
A system is indivisible from its inside running processes. The systems, as generalizations of reality, have a structure defined by their parts and processes. Between various parts of a system, functional and structural relationships exist that suggest processes of a transfer and exchange of energy and/or matter. On the other hand, input and output processes flow in a system for an exchange of energy and/or matter outside the system boundary with the outside environment and other systems.
According to these common considerations and the above-mentioned levels and stages of ontology building, a common ontology of general system and process is proposed.
